      <p>Building at the intersection of technology and health.</p>

      <p> My <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/aaryanxshah">LinkedIn</a> is mostly updated with my professional experience. I am finishing my BS in Computer Science
        and MS in Biomedical Data Science at Stanford. I am currently working at Canvas Medical as an engineer on the Applied AI team, working on agentic capabilities and clinical-grade AI governance within our EHR. </p>

      <p> When designing this page, I was in the middle of <a href="https://www.stripe.press/poor-charlies-almanack">Poor Charlie's Almanack</a> and had recently listened to the  <a href="https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/berkshire-hathaway-part-i">Berkshire Hathaway episode on the Acquired podcast</a>.</p>
