        Data Science at Stanford. I am currently working at Canvas Medical as an engineer on the Applied AI team,

          Poor Charlie's Almanack

          Berkshire Hathaway episode on the Acquired podcast

        played a rather instrumental role. Also, selfishly, given the growing utilization (and dependence) of coding
        agents, it felt satisfying to make this on my own with just web searches for HTML syntax.{" "}

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I'm from Fremont, CA and therefore, am an avid Bay Area sports fan. I had a David Lee jersey in 2012 and I
        consider that proof that I'm not a Warriors bandwagon.{" "}

        [February 2026] Will try to update these but currently reading Poor Charlie's Almanack, have switched from a lot
        of house / Beatles to the Acquired podcast, and am trying to get better at golf to use the Stanford golf course
        at the discounted rates at least once.
